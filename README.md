## Features

1. User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
2. Patient Records: I implemented a Django model for patients' records, capturing their full name, Date of Birth (DOB),Gender, Contact Number, Address, and Medical Condition.
3. Functionalities: The application provides views and templates for listing all patients' records, creating a new patient record,viewing a patient's details, updating a patient's record, and deleting a patient's record.
4. Form Validation: Proper form validation is in place to ensure that required fields are validated before submission.
##
Extra Features:
As an optional addition, I also implemented the following bonus features:
1. Search Functionality: Users can search for patients based on their names or medical conditions.
2. Pagination: Patient list pages are paginated to display a limited number of patients per page, improving the user experience.
3. Data Export: We can export the patient's data into Excel, CSV and pdf format.
4. Filter: I included a Filter option so we can filter the patient's data into certain entries like 5,10,15
5. Unit Tests: I included unit tests for critical parts of the application to ensure its stability and
reliability.
